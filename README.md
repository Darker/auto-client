I have created a video [chanel called LoL AutoClient](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKBWfX3cbOy9xeBKPGwsx-g/videos) where all features will be eventually explained and discussed. You can contact me using this channel as well.

## What is this?
This repository presents sourcecode for League of Legends PVP.net client bot that automatically accepts games, 
auto calls your lane. It is League of Legends auto login and auto queue. It auto accepts games, selects champion (without instalock) selects runes and masteries. Auto call your lane.

## Known problems

 - Sometimes, the text isn't called properly
 - Teambuilder captain mode is not 100% reliable at this moment
