## What is this?
 This repository presents source code for League of Legends PVP.net client bot that automatically accepts games, calls your lane, selects champion (without instalock), selects runes and masteries. It also supports auto login and auto queue.

## Known problems
**Issues about anything bellow will be closed without longer reply**

 - For setting to take effect, your focus must be on another text field
 - The program does not work when the PVP.net window is minimized (**won't fix**)
 - The text is not called properly sometimes
 - Teambuilder captain mode is not 100% reliable
 - Images on the main page of the client can confuse the automation
 
## Planned features
**Ordered by descending probability to be implemented**

 - Auto requeue
 - Automatically fetch runes and masteries names to replace indexes
 - Automatically accept game invitations
   - Include a blacklist/whitelist
 - Edit pixel coordinates externally
 - Rewrite in JavaScript
